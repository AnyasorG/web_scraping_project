# Module 11: Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves web scraping data from the [Mars News](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) website and analyzing Mars weather data. The task is divided into two parts, each represented by a Jupyter Notebook.

- **Deliverable 1**: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from [Mars News](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/)
- **Deliverable 2**: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

### Project Structure
The project is organized into two main folders, each corresponding to a deliverable. The structure is as follows:

- [part_1_mars_news.ipynb](./part_1_mars_news.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook for scraping Mars News titles and preview text.
- [part_2_mars_weather.ipynb](./part_2_mars_weather.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook for scraping and analyzing Mars weather data.

### Installation
To run the code, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Splinter
- Beautiful Soup
- Pandas

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebooks: [part_1_mars_news.ipynb](./part_1_mars_news.ipynb) and [part_2_mars_weather.ipynb](./part_2_mars_weather.ipynb).
2. Follow the instructions in each notebook to execute the code cells and run the analysis.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed by referring to the [Installation](#installation) section.
